#PPM Image Stacker

**Team Members:**
- Patrick Tharpe
- AJ Wolski

**Date:** 2025-02-27

## Overview

The PPM Image Stacker project is designed to reduce noise in astronomical images by averaging multiple noisy PPM images. The final stacked image is generated by computing the average red, green, and blue values for each pixel position across all images.

## Design Decisions

- **Language and Libraries:**
  The project is implemented in C++ using:
    - `<iostream>` for console input/output.
      - `<fstream>` for file operations.
        - `<string>` for string handling.
	  - `<vector>` for dynamic storage of pixel data.
	    - `<sstream>` for parsing the PPM file format.

- **Modular Organization:**
  - `stacker.h`: Contains the class declaration and inline documentation for all methods.
    - `stacker.cpp`: Implements the functionality declared in `stacker.h`.
      - `main.cpp`: Provides the driver and user interface for stacking images.
        - `Makefile`: Automates the compilation process.

## How to Run the Program

1. **Compile the Program:**
   Ensure you have g++ installed. From the project's root directory, run: make
   This command compiles all source files and produces the executable (e.g., `stacker`).

2. **Move Images**
   Move your folder of images into the same directory as 'stacker'
   ensure that the naming scheme of the folder and images is as follows:
   	name/name_###.ppm
   	'###' should start at 001 and make sure not to skip a number

4. **Run the Program:**
   Execute the program by typing: ./stacker
   Enter the name of the folder/image you want to stack
   enter in a number 1-n for the images you want to use


## Challenges and Solutions

- **Parsing PPM Files:**
Parsing the PPM header and body required careful handling of whitespace and formatting.

- **Averaging Pixel Data:**
Averaging pixel values across multiple images posed challenges with rounding and accumulation. We tried to ensure proper use of data types and arithmetic operations to compute averages for red, green, and blue channels.

## Work Sharing and Collaboration

- **Collaboration Process:**
Both team members contributed to the project using Git for version control. Our workflow included:
- One partner focusing on developing the core `Stacker` class functionality.
- The other partner handling the user interface in `main.cpp` and the README.md.

- **Communication:**
Regular meet ups during the weeks leading up to the due date helped us find success during this project.

## Conclusion

The PPM Image Stacker project demonstrates the process of reducing noise in images through averaging. By reading, processing, and stacking multiple PPM images, the final output shows significant improvement in image clarity.
